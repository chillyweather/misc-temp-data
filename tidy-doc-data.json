Rather than defining the a fluid buttonâs width in columns or mini units, its width is defined as a percentage (often 50%) of the containerâs width. Also, as a general rule, fluid primary buttons are never left-aligned in a layout or a containerâtheyâre always either right-aligned, or span the full width of the container.","publish":true},"5":{"title":"Do's and Don'ts","index":5,"datatype":"two-columns","content":{"subtitle1":"Do","subtitle2":"Don't","text1":"Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page.
