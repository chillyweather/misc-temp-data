Examples: commerce sites (products cards), price plans, kanban board, Pinterest.\nSummary page - Provide summaries of many/different kinds of content on the same page, such as dashboards, news feeds, blogs, etc.\nEmphasize few results - When you want to emphasize a few results over the rest. For example, show the first 3 results as cards and all the rest in a list or table.\nMobile view - on mobile, card view might be used instead of a tabular view.","text2":"Search experience (as search results) - when users are goal oriented to finding a specific item, card is less appropriate than a list.\nAs section divider - Don't force content into cards when spacing, headlines, or dividers would create a simpler visual hierarchy.\nComparing items - if users need to compare items, a list of table views are more appropriate.\nIn all the above cases, a card layout will be less appropriate because it is less scannable than a list and it takes a lot of space (less scrolling means less demand on users' short-term memory).\nFor search, consider using vertical cards (like a list, see below).

Prioritize the most important information.","Call for action – don’t add many call to action to your card, keep them at the end of the card. If you have many actions use action menu. If you have only one action, make the whole card clickable.","Give space - use grid which has same spacing between the cards, for easier scanning.","Don’t mix - card cannot be inside another card or divided into multiple cards.","Don’t scroll - A card should not have a vertical scroll, truncate the text, expand the card with a click or adjust the card size.","One unified unit - card can be stand-alone unit, it can be display without relying on another element in the page. It is not possible to swipe portions of the card, swipe should work on the whole card, and it should have only one swipe action assigned to it."],"listType":"unordered"}},"5":{"title":"Vertical","index":5,"datatype":"image","publish":true,"content":{"localFilePath":"","remoteImageLink":"https://xdc.invisionapp.com/assets/A_MGFjZjlkZDY2YjhlM2JmOS_lD2ON55Xorcb5qEJ66gV1dIMpe7Ojry4YAnohQVN0wk6Sq9aIwDJsRYmQzeKfQl8GlbrfXmPgtzMZru-Lb2g=?assetKey=xdc%2Fads-coral%2Fimage-B190yz533.png"}},"6":{"title":"Horizontal","index":6,"datatype":"image","publish":true,"content":{"localFilePath":"","remoteImageLink":"https://xdc.invisionapp.com/assets/A_MGFjZjlkZDY2YjhlM2JmOdr7AcN35piIxkzDfGrx2Kry5Z7eIFLFFahp_2em7vrSM5i2ZnemhGU9F-NGa1CL79CuQNkB0eJ-IuVcduv0Hbg=?assetKey=xdc%2Fads-coral%2Fimage-SkDWef9n2.png"}},"7":{"title":"Related components and patterns","index":7,"datatype":"link","publish":true,"content":{"inputs":[{"source":"Card button","link":"https://www.figma.com/proto/9KXDuflEXQTfqirV9D7lYu/Amdocs-Documentation?page-id=368%3A2359&type=design&node-id=472-24925&viewport=1286%2C725%2C0.28&t=2u6Ut0hXlV2wX8Md-1&scaling=min-zoom&mode=design"}]}},"8":{"title":"Reference","index":8,"datatype":"link","publish":true,"content":{"inputs":[{"source":"NNg","link":"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/"},{"source":"Material Design","link":"https://m3.material.io/components/cards/guidelines"},{"source":"Carbon Design System (IBM)","link":"https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tile/usage/"}]}},"9":{"title":"Basic example","index":9,"datatype":"video","publish":true,"content":{"selectedVideo":0,"selectedVideoContent":{"element":"Card","name":"Basic card element","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJN_Q01ZnM4?si=g5kAoHcObtLhT6Tj","thumbnail":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HJN_Q01ZnM4/sddefault.jpg"}}},"10":{"title":"Complex example","index":10,"datatype":"video","publish":true,"content":{"selectedVideo":1,"selectedVideoContent":{"element":"Card","name":"Complex card element","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vna2a4g8WyQ?si=NLfnKX-7f4T9DQxy","thumbnail":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vna2a4g8WyQ/sddefault.jpg"}}},"11":{"title":"MUI Reference","index":11,"datatype":"link","publish":true,"content":{"inputs":[{"source":"React-card","link":"https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/"}]}},"12":{"title":"Release Notes","index":12,"datatype":"element","publish":false}},"8470:1817":{"0":{"title":"uiol;up","index":0,"datatype":"header","element":{"id":"8470:1817"},"content":{"firstResource":"i","firstResourceLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D7%93%D7%9F+%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9C%E2%80%AD/@32.0790423,34.8256426,19.98z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x151d4ba69f69836b:0xc99e25d6c2d8d9ba!8m2!3d32.079001!4d34.8256572!16s%2Fg%2F11gpn1fmhq?entry=ttu","secondResource":"o","secondResourceLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D7%93%D7%9F+%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9C%E2%80%AD/@32.0790423,34.8256426,19.98z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x151d4ba69f69836b:0xc99e25d6c2d8d9ba!8m2!3d32.079001!4d34.8256572!16s%2Fg%2F11gpn1fmhq?entry=ttu"},"publish":true},"1":{"title":"","index":1,"datatype":"image","publish":true,"content":{"localFilePath":"","remoteImageLink":"https://www.aquasec.com/wp-content/themes/aqua3/images/pillars/pillar_infrastructure_01_07.png"}}}}
