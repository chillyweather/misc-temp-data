They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it. \n\nButton alignment is also closely related to whether the button is treated as a default or a fluid element within a layout. When we say “fluid”, we mean that the button becomes a part of a larger, compound component by bleeding to two or more edges of its container. Rather than defining the a fluid button’s width in columns or mini units, its width is defined as a percentage (often 50%) of the container’s width. Also, as a general rule, fluid primary buttons are never left-aligned in a layout or a container—they’re always either right-aligned, or span the full width of the container.\n\n\n","publish":false}}
