Spectroscopy has revealed that Sedna's surface composition is largely a mixture of water, methane, and nitrogen ices with tholins, similar to those of some other trans-Neptunian objects. Its surface is one of the reddest among Solar System objects. Sedna, within estimated uncertainties, is tied with Ceres as the largest planetoid not known to have a moon. It has a diameter of approximately 1,000 km (most likely between the sizes of the dwarf planet Ceres and Saturn's moon Tethys), with an unknown mass.\n\nSedna's orbit is one of the largest in the Solar System, with its aphelion (farthest distance from the Sun) being approximately 937 astronomical units (AU).[6] This is 31 times Neptune's distance from the Sun, and well beyond the closest portion of the heliopause, which defines the outer boundary of interplanetary space. As of 2023, Sedna is near perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, at a distance of 84 AU (13 billion km), almost three times farther than Neptune. The dwarf planets Eris and Gonggong are presently further from the Sun than Sedna. An exploratory fly-by mission to Sedna at perihelion could be completed in 24.5 years using a Jupiter gravity assist.[15]","publish":true}}}
